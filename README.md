# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict whether a person has diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements using machine learning techniques. The Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset is used, which contains 8 medical predictor variables and a target variable indicating the presence of diabetes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which can be found on Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)

## Usage

1. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the project directory with the name `diabetes.csv`.

2. Run the `diabetes_prediction.py` script:

3. The script will load the dataset, preprocess the data, train a logistic regression model, and evaluate its performance. The accuracy and confusion matrix will be printed in the console.


## Project Structure

- `diabetes_prediction.py`: The main Python script that loads the dataset, preprocesses the data, trains the model, and evaluates its performance.
- `diabetes.csv`: The Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (to be downloaded from Kaggle).
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.

## Results

The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of [insert accuracy here] on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting diabetes based on the given diagnostic measurements.
